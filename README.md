Project Description
Project name: Redemption

I was inspired to do this project by the story of Arthur Morgan, the main character in Red Dead Redemption 2. Based on the 1899 history of the pioneering West in the United States, this game tells the story of the era of the West that saw its final twilight, when Arthur and the gang members were wanted and hunted for their lives, unwilling to succumb to the inhumane, profit-oriented politicians and capitalists.

As the project begins, words representing the era make up the images of Arthur's characters. However, as the mouse clicks and moves, the words begin to wobble, and the form of the character's image scatters and ripples. Nevertheless, the process of dispersion is not a peaceful one. As the mouse moves, the scattered words form waves of varying intensity and the music changes in rhythm and pitch.

These words form images of Arthur's characters, representing the people and ideologies of the Old West. The mouse arrows represent politicians and capitalists in the garb of civilisation and a dysfunctional new order and ideology. They are on the crutches of the law, but through hands stained with the blood of ordinary people, they seek to profit and develop a false sense of fairness in society. These led to a life of hardship and suffering. Ideologies were shaken, lives were squeezed, and lives were trampled. Like the waves formed by the words, people struggled to survive in their plight but had to continue to follow the times. In the midst of this, no matter how strong people were in the old days, they could not change the course of the times. Moreover, background music is like the cry of the people. During the process, the sound is either harsh or low.

The events of Arthur's life are a microcosm of these times. It is not without some irony that barbaric people do civilised things while civilised people do barbaric things. However, for civilisation to put an end to barbarism and to establish the order that civilisation needs, then it needs to put an end to barbarism in a way that is more barbaric than barbaric. This was also the path of Western civilisation, which rose rapidly after the Industrial Revolution. In 1899, a time of social transition, when social contradictions abounded, a new order had not yet been formed, and old values were slowly collapsing, civilisation and barbarism were not just two sides of the same coin. They were more like a pair of severely deformed Siamese twins. The only thing that man could do in this chaos was to redeem himself.
